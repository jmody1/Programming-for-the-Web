Betty Botter bought some butter,
but the butter, it was bitter.
If she put it in her batter, it would make her batter bitter,
but a bit of better butter, that would make her batter better.
So, she bought a bit of butter, better than her bitter butter,
And she put it in her batter, and her batter was not bitter.
So, T'was better Betty Botter bought a bit of better butter.
